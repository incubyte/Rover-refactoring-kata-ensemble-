# Rover refactoring kata - Java (Gradle + JUnit)
This kata is ported from the following ts code with the help of claude ai
https://github.com/khru/code-smells-refactoring-training-ts/tree/main/01-refactoring-smelly-mars-rover

The purpose of this mob programming kata is to refactor the existing code for rover using concepts from clean code book's chapter number 6 - "Objects & Data Structures".

Before starting: -
- Create a separate branch for your attempt and inform everyone in the session to switch to that branch.
- Select on a solid goal on what you need to accomplish in this session. No more than 2 small and achievable goals. (eg: to learn the concept of Objects and Data structures). Strictly stick to this goal.

- Write down your names below to track the order for "Driver", and "Navigator" role.

  - Peter
  - Tony
  - Steve
  - ...

## Note
- It is not advisable to have more than 6-7 people for a session.
- Before switching, announce your roles to the mob. Something like "I am Tony, and I am the driver" -> "I am Peter, and I am the navigator" -> "I am Steve, and I am next" 
- You can also use tools like - https://remotemob.io/ or https://mobtimer.zoeetrope.com/ to keep the time and order in check
- You can install https://mob.sh/ for quickly commiting your changes to the next person
- Be respectful and follow proper protocols to derive maximum benefits and fun from this exercise!
